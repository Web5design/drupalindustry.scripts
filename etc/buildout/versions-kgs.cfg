[versions]
# Know good set (KGS) of versions, generated automatically by buildout
# extension, i.e. buildout-versions.
# Note: the versions pinned here are those which have not been explicitely
# pinned yet. If your project requires an explicit version of a dependency,
# you should specify it elsewhere, i.e. in "versions" part of versions.cfg.
# If you want to upgrade your project:
# 
# * Delete lines below;
# * Run buildout in "newest" mode (i.e. implicitely without -N or explicitely
#  with -n option).
